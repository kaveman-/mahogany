# This is the "real" Makefile for the c-client directory.  It kludges
# around the Makefile provided with the library, coercing it to work
# with the Mahogany build system.

# setup is $(OSDEP), so if it is present, we're ready to go.

# use a slightly modified version of it

# initial make call, prepare the scene for the invocation of c-client/Makefile
# 
# 1. create the links to the files in the source directory
# 2. create helper files (SPECIALS, ...)
# 3. fix for the problem with files not having executable bit in the cvs
#
# NB: can't use "ls -sf" in step 1 because it doesn't overwrite existing files
#     under Solaris (don't ask me why), hence test for files existence
#     explicitly
