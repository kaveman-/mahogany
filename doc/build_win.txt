0. Requirements
---------------

a) Microsoft Visual C++ compiler: currently, version 2013 is used for building
   Mahogany. Older versions of Visual C++ (back to 2010) could probably be
   still used as well but were not recently tested. Newer versions (2015 as of
   this writing) can almost certainly be used as well.

   If you are interested in building using another compiler (e.g. mingw32)
   please contact us and we will try to help you.

b) Git: you need to have access to Mahogany (and sometimes wxWidgets) source
   tree.

c) GNU m4 from cygwin tools: this is not an absolute requirement, however you
   will not be able to compile *.mid (Mahogany Interface Description) files if
   you don't have it and so you will have to use the versions already in the
   svn. If you do have m4, set the environment variable M4 to contain its full
   path (or just m4 if it is in your PATH), otherwise it won't be used.


1. Visual C++
-------------

a) wxWidgets
------------

   Mahogany depends on wxWidgets and prior to compiling Mahogany you need to
build the wxMSW library.

   Mahogany requires wxWidgets 3.0 or later. The latest available 3.0.x release
should be used.

   Before building Mahogany you will need to build wxWidgets. To do it, you
should open build/msw/wx_vc12.sln in wxWidgets directory and build all projects
in it.

   Finally, set wxwin environment variable to the location of wxWidgets
sources before opening M.sln as it uses it to find wxWidgets headers and
libraries.


b) Python
---------

   If you want to build Mahogany with an embedded Python interpreter, you need
to have Python 2.6 or 2.7 built with the same compiler you use for building
Mahogany itself installed. You also need to add the path to include
subdirectory of your Python installation to the "Include files" list in
"Tools|Options|Projects and Solutions|VC++ Directories".

   Otherwise you may simply remove or comment out the line #defining USE_PYTHON
in include/config_nt.h to disable embedded Python. You will also have to
exclude files in "interfaces\python" subfolder of "Source file" in M project
from build.


c) Build process
----------------

   Simply open the solution file M.sln in Visual C++ IDE. Here is a brief
description of various projects in the solution:

* M - the main Mahogany project
* imap - the mail routines support library
* compface - the library for X-Face handling
* versit - vCard library
* dspam - the spam filtering library

   Just build everything. Before running M.exe, copy the file versit.dll
produced when building versit project into the root Mahogany directory (or
elsewhere in your PATH).

   If you encounter any problems with Mahogany (e.g. crashes...), please build
the debug configuration and run it under debugger, this often provides valuable
additional information.
